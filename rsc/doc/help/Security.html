<h1>Security GUI</h1>
<p>The Security program links with an existing camera in the network. Once linked, the program will display the Idle screen and the camera will continoiusly scan to detect a face. The detected face is then recognised using facial recognition. Anti-spoofing algorithms are also run during this process to detect whether the face is real. Passing the Anti-Spoofing process, the recognised user is then given access depending if they have access to the room according to the "Access" table in the database. The main window of the program displays the output to the user whether they have been granted or denied access to the room. The room unlocks and has a 15 second time until it locks a returns to the Idle screen. This program is password protected and requires a user with Access Level 1 to setup the link between the program and camera.</p>
